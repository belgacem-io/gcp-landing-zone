## Purpose

For the sake of enhanced security and streamlined management, our architecture includes a distinct folder for each environment, with the capacity to extend this division into individual security zones as well. Within each environment-specific folder, we create a series of projects intended to provide shared services across the various projects housed in the same folder. This organized approach is designed to facilitate effective cooperation and secure operation within each individual environment.
